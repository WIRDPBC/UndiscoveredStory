                <p>
                    The teams founders and senior leadership have helped to launch and continue to support global charitable initiatives focused on some of society's most urgent challenges. We've collaborated with internationally renowned change agents including Jane Goodall, Thich Nhat Hanh and Malala Yousafzai.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Projects we've supported in developing countries include efforts to ensure clean drinking water, preserve wildlife habitats, promote education for girls, protect endangered species and support entrepreneurship through micro-financing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the USA, Team WIRD collaborates with a number of charities that are tackling the growing epidemic of homelessness, as well as addressing the issues of food insecurity, sustainable development and climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We actively seek out philanthropic and pro social NGOs, non-profits and foundations to support whose work has demonstrated actionable results, with a specific focus on those organizations that are led by and support women and girls.
