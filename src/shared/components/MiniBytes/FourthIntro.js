                    WIRD (pronounced weird) was conceived out of the notion that people want to do good for themselves, for their communities and around the world.
        </p>
                <p>
                    When something is weird, it’s thought to be different or strange — that it stands apart from the crowd. We stand apart in distinct ways, primarily by fostering engaged community and providing a means for people to get involved in real world causes, powered by the immutability of distributed ledger technologies.
        </p>
                <p>
                    WIRD encourages community-led initiatives that incentivize participation and generate positive impact.
