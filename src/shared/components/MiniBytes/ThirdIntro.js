            <div className="introduction-content-container">
            <p>The decision to launch Undiscovered Story, our inaugural blockchain product, was based on the following critical assumptions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cryptocurrency and blockchain is confusing to the majority of the general public</li>
                    <li>Users would be highly responsive to a crypto trivia game that would give them the opportunity to earn tokens by answering multiple choice questions</li>
                    <li>Our target audience seeks out products and services that support initiatives for social good</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Undiscovered Story gives players the opportunity to earn crypto, do social good and learn about the contributions and achievements of girls and women in a variety of fields throughout history and around the world while playing a fun and interactive trivia game.
