# PWA - Progressive web application

The game is being built as a PWA utilizing React.JS and Node.JS

# Firebase (Google) PWA 

We are using Firebase for real time from client to server or server to client data transfer, which allows us to create a database with real time communication, and scalability on the fly as Firebase utilizes JSON.

Having a NoSQL allows us to create any field (assign value) at any point without destroying the structure or functionality. 

Having a combination of a Progressive Web App (PWA) with Firebase allows non-breakable communication between server and client.

# The technology stack (the platforms) the Hybrid Blockchchain game is built upon

Hybrid Blockchain Game Development for Secure and Scalable Mass Adoption developed in house by WIRD. 

Two (2) instantly scalable CDN cloud based servers running simultaneously.

One “offchain” Google / Firebase server and database where the actual Undiscovered Story game application is hosted.

One “on chain” server solution built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) where we have deployed Stellar´s Blockchain Smart Contract API and where all Stellar Smart Contract API calls are being served.

This hydrid setup allows us to take advantage of the secure and lightning fast payment and accounting benefits of the Stellar Blockchain and smart contract API system and rollout additional feature upgrades offchain on the Firebase server) without affecting the “on chain” smart contract functionality or security.

All “off-chain” applications upgrades are instantly updated transparently for the users.
