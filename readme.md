# PWA - Progressive web application

The game is being built as a PWA utilizing React.JS and Node.JS

# FIREBASE (GOOGLE) PWA 

Google Firebase and Firebase PWA Progressive Web App info
https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/
 
We are using Firebase for real time from client to server or server to client data transfer, which allows us to create a database with real time communication, and scalability on the fly as Firebase utilizes JSON.

Having a NoSQL allows us to create any field (assign value) at any point without destroying the structure or functionality. 

Having a combination of a Progressive Web App (PWA) with Firebase allows non-breakable communication between server and client.

# The Undiscovered Story Game Hybrid Blockchchain
Hybrid Blockchain Game Development for Secure and Scalable Mass Adoption developed in house by WIRD. 

A Hybrid blockchain game built for use by the masses, easy enough for a grandma to use and play with her daughters or grandchildren.  

# The technology stack (the platforms) the game is built upon  

Two (2) instantly scalable CDN cloud based servers running simultaneously.

One “offchain” Google / Firebase server and database where the actual Undiscovered Story game application is hosted.

One “on chain” server solution built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) where we have deployed Stellar´s Blockchain Smart Contract API and where all Stellar Smart Contract API calls are being served.

This hydrid setup allows us to take advantage of the secure and lightning fast payment and accounting benefits of the Stellar Blockchain and smart contract API system and rollout additional feature upgrades offchain on the Firebase server) without affecting the “on chain” smart contract functionality or security.

All “off-chain” applications upgrades are instantly updated transparently for the users.

# ------------------------------------ On-Chain versus Off-Chain? -------------------------

# On-Chain

1).  Miner or participant are required to validate all transactions.  Depending on the blockchain used, “On-chain” transactions can have a lengthy lag time depending upon the network load and number of transactions waiting in the queue to be confirmed.

# Off-Chain

1). Transactions can be executed instantly.
2). Transactions usually don't have a transaction fee, as nothing occurs on the blockchain.
3).  More security and anonymity to the participants because details are not publicly broadcast as is the case of on-chain transactions.
